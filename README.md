# Multiplayer Chess Program
 
Two Player Game

# Dependencies
 • Chess Module (legal moves, and win detection)
 • Pygame 2.0.1 (for the main program)
 • PyQt5 (for the message box, and promotions, as pygame doesn't support multiple windows being open at the same time)
 • Numpy (for lists)
 
# How to Play
You can play by clicking on a piece, and then it shows the legal moves for it. Then you must click on one of the legal squares, and it will move. This is not touch move, so you can click on as many pieces as you like. There are also other features, which are a takeback button, a resign button, a draw button, and time control. A takeback button, which your opponent has to accept, and a message box will popup. Same as the draw offer button. Only the draw button gives another messages which says that the game is a draw. The resign button will just give another message box that says the winner by resignation. For time control, it is 15 + 10, so each player has 15 minutes in total to play their moves, and they gain 10 seconds after a move is played. Off course, if your time runs out, then you lose the game. Win detection not only includes checkmates, but also stalemate, insuffient material, and fifty move rule. 

# Enjoy!
